Objective:
To develop a Python application that generates strong, random passwords of user-defined length and complexity, helping users enhance their online security by creating secure passwords easily.

**Key Activities:**
1.Importing Libraries
string: Provides access to pre-defined character sets (like letters, digits, punctuation).
random: Used to randomly select characters for the password.
2.Displaying a Title
Shows a heading to indicate that this is a password generator.
3.Taking User Input for Password Length
Asks the user to enter the desired length of the password.
4.Converts the input to an integer.
Validating User Input (Using Try-Except)
Checks if the input is a valid number.
5.Ensures the number is positive.
If not, shows an error message and exits the program.
Combining All Possible Characters
All are combined into a single pool for random selection.
6.Generating the Password
Initializes an empty string for the password.
Loops for the number of times specified by the user.
Each time, it picks a random character from the combined pool and adds it to the password.
7.Displaying the Final Password
Shows the final generated password to the user.

**Technologies Used:**
1.Python Programming Language
The entire program is written in Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for simplicity and readability.
2.string Module
Provides predefined character sets:
string.ascii_letters: A–Z and a–z.
string.digits: 0–9.
string.punctuation: Symbols like !@#$%^&*.
3.random Module
Used for generating randomness.
random.choice(): Picks a random character from a list or string.
4.Input/Output (I/O)
input() to take user input.
print() to display output.
5.Data Types
int: Converts input from string to integer.
str: For handling strings (passwords and characters).
6.Error Handling
try-except: Handles invalid input like non-numeric values.
Prevents the program from crashing due to errors.
7.Conditional Statements
if statement checks if password length is greater than 0.
8.Loops
for loop is used to repeat actions (generating each character).
9.String Concatenation
Adds each randomly selected character to form the final password.
10.Program Exit
exit(): Stops the program if invalid input is detected.

**Key Insights:**
1. Purpose of the Code
The code is designed to generate a random password of a user-specified length.
It uses a combination of letters, digits, and special characters to create a strong password.
2. Importing Necessary Modules
import string: This module provides sequences of various character types like letters, digits, and punctuation.
import random: This module is used to generate random choices, essential for creating unpredictable passwords.
3. User Input and Validation
The program prompts the user to enter the desired password length.
It converts the input into an integer using int().
Error Handling:
If the user enters a non-numeric value, a ValueError is caught, and the program prints an error message and exits.
If the user enters a number less than or equal to zero, the program prints a message indicating the length should be positive and exits
This ensures the program only proceeds with valid input.
4. Character Set for Password Generation
The variable characters combines:
string.ascii_letters: All uppercase and lowercase English letters (A-Z, a-z).
string.digits: All digits from 0 to 9.
string.punctuation: Special characters like !@#$%^&*(), etc.
This wide range of characters helps in generating a strong and complex password.
5. Password Generation Logic
An empty string password is initialized.
A for loop runs length times (the user-defined length).
In each iteration, a random character is chosen from characters using random.choice() and appended to password.
This process ensures the password is randomly constructed character by character.
6. Output
After the loop completes, the generated password is printed to the console.
The password is displayed with a clear message: Generated Password: <password>.
7. Code Structure and Readability
The code uses basic control flow and exception handling to make it robust.
